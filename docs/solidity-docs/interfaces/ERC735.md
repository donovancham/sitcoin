# `ERC735`

The following describes standard functions for adding, removing and holding of claims. These claims can attested from third parties (issuers) or self attested.

# Functions:

- [`getClaim(bytes32 _claimId)`](#ERC735-getClaim-bytes32-)

- [`getClaimIdsByTopic(uint256 _topic)`](#ERC735-getClaimIdsByTopic-uint256-)

- [`addClaim(uint256 _topic, uint256 _scheme, address _issuer, bytes _signature, bytes _data, string _uri)`](#ERC735-addClaim-uint256-uint256-address-bytes-bytes-string-)

- [`removeClaim(bytes32 _claimId)`](#ERC735-removeClaim-bytes32-)

## getClaim

<br>

```Solidity

function getClaim(

  bytes32 _claimId

) external returns (uint256 topic, uint256 scheme, address issuer, bytes signature, bytes data, string uri)

```

Returns a claim by ID.

### Parameters:

- `_claimId`: The ID of the Claim.

### Return Values:

- `topic`: A `uint256` number which represents the topic of the claim. (e.g. 1 biometric, 2 residence...)

- `scheme`: The scheme with which this claim SHOULD be verified or how it should be processed. Its a `uint256` for different schemes. E.g. could `3` mean contract verification, where the `data` will be call data, and the `issuer` a contract address to call (ToBeDefined). Those can also mean different key types e.g. 1 = ECDSA, 2 = RSA, etc. 

- `issuer`: The issuers identity contract address, or the address used to sign the above signature. If an identity contract, it should hold the key with which the above message was signed, if the key is not present anymore, the claim SHOULD be treated as invalid. The issuer can also be a contract address itself, at which the claim can be verified using the call `data`.

- `signature`: Signature which is the proof that the claim issuer issued a claim of topic for this identity.

- `data`: The hash of the claim data, sitting in another location, a bit-mask, call data, or actual data based on the claim scheme.

- `uri`: The location of the claim, this can be HTTP links, swarm hashes, IPFS hashes, and such.

## getClaimIdsByTopic

<br>

```Solidity

function getClaimIdsByTopic(

  uint256 _topic

) external returns (bytes32[] claimIds)

```

Returns an array of claim IDs by topic.

### Parameters:

- `_topic`: The topic of the Claims to get.

### Return Values:

- `claimIds`: The `byte32` array of the Claims.

## addClaim

<br>

```Solidity

function addClaim(

  uint256 _topic,

  uint256 _scheme,

  address _issuer,

  bytes _signature,

  bytes _data,

  string _uri

) external returns (bytes32 claimRequestId)

```

Requests the ADDITION or the CHANGE of a claim from an `issuer`. 

### Parameters:

- `_topic`: A `uint256` number which represents the topic of the claim. (e.g. 1 biometric, 2 residence...)

- `_scheme`: The scheme with which this claim SHOULD be verified or how it should be processed. Its a `uint256` for different schemes. E.g. could `3` mean contract verification, where the `data` will be call data, and the `issuer` a contract address to call (ToBeDefined). Those can also mean different key types e.g. 1 = ECDSA, 2 = RSA, etc. 

- `_issuer`: The issuers identity contract address, or the address used to sign the above signature. If an identity contract, it should hold the key with which the above message was signed, if the key is not present anymore, the claim SHOULD be treated as invalid. The issuer can also be a contract address itself, at which the claim can be verified using the call `data`.

- `_signature`: Signature which is the proof that the claim issuer issued a claim of topic for this identity. `_signature` is a signed message of the following structure: keccak256(address identityHolder_address, uint256 topic, bytes data).

- `_data`: The hash of the claim data, sitting in another location, a bit-mask, call data, or actual data based on the claim scheme.

- `_uri`: The location of the claim, this can be HTTP links, swarm hashes, IPFS hashes, and such.

### Return Values:

- `claimRequestId`: COULD be send to the `approve` function, to approve or reject this claim.

## removeClaim

<br>

```Solidity

function removeClaim(

  bytes32 _claimId

) external returns (bool success)

```

Removes a claim.

### Parameters:

- `_claimId`: The ID of the Claim to be removed.

### Return Values:

- `success`: `TRUE` if successful.
